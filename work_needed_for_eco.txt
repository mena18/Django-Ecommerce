- i don't need to work a lot on it or to add a lot of features but i must fix all bugs first so my next steps are :-





- registration problem
- login problem
- make login_required pages instead of giving that error


- write project tests

- fix problem of the footer 


- checkout error address must exists
- add new items to make it look real
- fix search
- get releated items in the one page

- continue tests

- document the project
